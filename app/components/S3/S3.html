                        <p>Sometimes you simply can’t control things. The environment might have failed so rapidly that there’s not a darn thing you can do about it. And you may have very limited control over your physical or behavioral responses. You may be paralyzed - perhaps with fear. But there is always one thing you do have control over right up until your dying breath, and that is your attitude, which no one can take away from you. You cannot really control another person’s behavior, nor can they control what you do. Granted, it may be extremely difficult to control your responses to another person’s actions. But, ultimately, that control resides within you via your attitude, and it just may save your life.<br><br>
I have a very good friend whose life was saved because of his attitude. He just retired as a special agent in charge of a tactical training program at the FBI Academy. We now work together creating adventure programs at Saddlebrook Resort for corporate clients who want to learn how to overcome fear. In the late 1960’s, Phil was in Vietnam as part of a special unit that was ambushed by the enemy. Everyone in the unit was killed, except Phil, who should have died. He was hit 13 times with bullets from AK47 machine guns. But, he survived against all medical odds. I once asked him why? Why it was he was able to overcome such medical odds. He replied, “While I was lying on the ground unable to move, feeling the life literally drain out of me, I was absolutely determined that I was going to stay awake so when the enemy came over to slit my throat or put a bullet in my head, I was going to spit in their faces and glare at them so that they would know that I was dying on my terms and not on theirs.” Well, it turned out that he had killed the enemy. There was no one left to slit his throat, so he remained awake until, eventually, an evacuation helicopter arrived.<br><br>
That is exactly the type of fighting spirit that Dr. Bernie Segal writes and lectures about, a spirit that characterizes individuals who do not accept the belief of others. When they are told by their healthcare provider that the odds of surviving the cancer are very remote, they reply by saying, “My body doesn’t know about statistics. I am not average. I’m going to be the exception.” They are the people who take control. They fight until the bitter end, and often they overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, just as Victor Frankel did when he was incarcerated in the Nazi concentration camps. He was once asked why it was he survived when so many others died from starvation, disease, and torture. His answer was eloquent in its simplicity, “The belief that one day I would be asked that question.” He was able to see beyond the barbed wire, as he remained optimistic that there would be life after the camp. In addition, he seized control over those things in his life that he could influence. There was much he wasn’t able to control; but, by ritualizing the act of brushing his teeth in the morning and by making a big production of getting dressed, he seized control over the small things in his environment that he was able to influence. He never surrendered his spirit to that feeling of total helplessness.<br><br>
No one sprinkles you with magical dust to induce a belief that you can’t do something. No one presses a button in the side of your head that induces an emotion. These are your responses, and no one can ever control them for you. No one. In the end, the very belief, ‘You are in control,’ may save your life. It may also enable you to endure one of the greatest fears we have in Western society, which is the fear of dying.<br><br>Several years ago, I learned of a study that is currently illegal in the state in which it was carried out. Some would consider it to be immoral, as well, although I’ll leave that judgment up to you, the reader. It involved assisted suicide, and it went on for a number of years. Despite what you read in newspapers, Dr. Kevorkian, probably, is the rule, not the exception. But, most doctors involved do not make a political issue out of it. I was giving a lecture on spirituality and healing at a national gathering of clergy. All of the major religions and denominations were represented. There were rabbis, priests, and ministers. The one thing that they shared in common was specializing in ministering to people who were dying. Many of them were hospital chaplains or worked for Hospice. Of course, I was surprised that members of the cloth would be doing this type of research because it seemed counter to their religious teachings. When I raised this issue, their overwhelming reply was that if a person is ever in need of their spiritual resources, it is when they are making that final transition from life to death. They were going to be there for that person.<br><br>
In this study, when a patient asked for an extract of hemlock or for a medication that would enable them to terminate the dying process, the doctor would make it available, but not administer it. “Here it is. I’m going to leave it on this table or place it in this drawer within easy reach. And this is how much you take.” Then the member of the clergy granted the person permission by telling them that it was okay. I was informed that out of more than two dozen people, not a single one chose to take that final step, even though all initially had requested the lethal medication dose to be administered. Of course, this resolves both the legal and moral dilemma because it was no longer assisted suicide. It turned out that they weren’t afraid of being dead – what they were afraid of was the process of dying. “Will I lose control?”-- “Will I be in excruciating pain?” -- “Will I be a burden to my loved ones?” They were provided with the means by which they could believe they were in control. Simply the perception or the image of having control, right up until their dying breath, was all that it took to enable them to deal with the issue. If being in control overcomes the fear of dying, can you imagine what benefits it could provide in lesser circumstances? Never give up.</p>
