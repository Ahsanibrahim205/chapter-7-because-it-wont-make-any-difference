                    <h1>Personality<em> and Goals</em></h1>
                </div>
                <p>I’m sure that you’ve heard of the so- called Type A personality, the person who is always in a hurry, who never takes time out to smell the roses, who often speaks rapidly, and who finishes your sentences for you because he gets impatient waiting for you to finish saying whatever it is you’re going to say, probably because whatever you have to say is not important to him in the first place.<br><br>
There is a certain amount of overlap between the Type A personality and what is referred to as the controlling personality. This person is basically in a win/lose mode. “I’m going to win; you’re going to lose. We are going to do it my way, or we are not going to do it at all.” This person is personally threatened by dialogue. If you disagree with him, he’ll take it as a personal affront. “Why waste time talking about the problem? We’re going to do it my way, anyway, so let’s just get on with it.”<br><br>
You’ve probably heard that it is the time-oriented, controlling personality who is most likely to succumb to a heart attack. Well, that’s only partially correct. That was the interpretation of the data from the Framingham Heart Study when first completed. And on the basis of the limited information available to the psychologists at that time, that was the correct interpretation. But, it was only a correlation. Subsequently, Dr. Redford Williams and others designed more expansive studies. It turns out that they discovered there was something else that accounted for most of the correlations between the Type A personality and coronary arterial disease. Anger and hostility, the emotions of stress, were largely responsible. In other words, it’s all right to be a workaholic, just don’t be an angry, hostile workaholic. And if you are, for heaven’s sake, don’t internalize it. That makes things even worse.<br><br>
Let’s consider now the so-called Type C personality. This is the person who is the opposite of the controller, one you would call the accommodator. This person is in a lose/win mode. “I’m going to lose; you’re going to win. Your needs are more important than mine. There’s no point in talking about this since we’re going to do it your way, anyway.” This is the person Lydia Temoshok labeled as the Type C or cancer-prone personality. This is the person George Solomon described as being susceptible to rheumatoidarthritis. This is a very passive individual, one who will experience a great deal of personal discomfort in order to please other people. Evidence suggests that they have a difficult time dealing with negative emotions, especially in others. In a clinical setting, this person will wait until his throat is parched before troubling the staff for a glass of water. Then he will apologize for having taken your time. He is just the opposite of that Type A on the second floor, the one who constantly is demanding the nurses’ time, wanting to know, “Why am I taking this pill and that pill, and what do you mean waking me at 2 o’clock in the morning to give me a sleeping pill?” He is the person who in the clinical setting is often labeled as difficult to manage. It’s no surprise that’s the person who does not get much voluntary attention. Yet, despite this, the demanding person is the one who is most likely going to survive, whereas the passive, sweet individual is likely to experience a worse outcome.<br><br>
Reflect for just a moment on these two personalities, but from the standpoint of control. The person asking the questions would not do so if he did not believe that there were going to be an outcome. In other words, he has made himself a part of the negotiation of his treatment. He has given himself a metaphorical bar to press. In contrast, the Type C individual has basically abdicated responsibility, handing it over to the healthcare provider. “Here I am. Do whatever you will.” Oh, I’m sure that there are many factors and explanations as to why one person has a better prognosis than another. But, in view of the data that I briefly summarized a little while ago, there is no question in my mind that giving up control is a very important variable. Acting like a victim is never healthy.<br><br>
There’s another personality type that you hear about, which is the so- called Type T or Thrill Seeking personality. These are people who take calculated risks and include bungee jumpers, skydivers, and motorcycle racers. It is the Type T individual who does not accept conventional wisdom or certain existing beliefs. This is a person who explores new horizons and who is always looking for a different way to do things. This is the person who makes discoveries and who is not afraid of risk, indeed, who thrives on it.<br><br>
It doesn’t hurt to have at least a small amount of Type-T in your makeup. After all, doing something different, even if it’s positive, carries the inherent risk of failure. An unwillingness to take such risks may be what’s holding you back.<br><br>
There are other personalities as well. For example, there’s the collaborator, who is in a win/win mode. “I want to win, but I’m concerned about your needs. I want you to win as well.” This person is very different from the controller. Collaborators are energized by disagreement. They welcome dialogue.<br><br>
There are also avoiders, who are the corporate equivalent of repressors. “Problem? What problem?” These same people fail to acknowledge unmet needs within their own body, just as they neglect important issues in the workplace.<br><br>
These are just a few of the designations used to describe personality types. I want you to realize that there is nothing wrong with any of them. Just like beliefs, it is not the personality that is good or bad, but the context in which it is exhibited. Thank goodness all of our mothers were, at least temporarily, Type C’s. Thank goodness they were willing to sacrifice their own need for sleep in order to nurture us as infants. We would never have survived if they had not been willing to do that. In that environment, being a Type C is a beneficial response. It is not good, however, when you are recovering in a hospital bed, and you place other people’s needs ahead of your own – not when you are the one who needs the nurturing.<br><br>
You might believe the collaborator is the best way to be, and it, most certainly, is in many environments, especially the business environment. When I’m lecturing to corporate clients, that is exactly what I encourage them to be like. The focus used to be on always winning. Now, a more collaborative stance is advocated for many work environments. Organizations recognize that even their competitors play a useful role in the economic eco-system.<br><br>
But there are times when being the collaborator is not the best way to be. If you happen to be a law enforcement agent staring down a criminal’s gun, that is not the time to be asking, “Look, I really want to know what your needs are. How about I just cuff one of your hands, would that be all right?” In law enforcement, coming in second is not good enough. Winning is everything, just as it is in the healthcare setting. When you are the person who has been diagnosed with cancer, you don’t want your doctor coming up to you and saying, “Look, there is a treatment for which you are an ideal candidate, and it’s practically guaranteed to put your cancer into remission. The problem is it is still considered by some insurance companies, including yours, as being experimental, so they won’t pay for it. But that’s okay. There’s another treatment. It’s not as good, although there’s still an 80 percent chance you’ll survive by using that treatment.” You are not going to accept that kind of collaboration. There is only one option in that circumstance, and that is the best and the most effective treatment. If the insurance doesn’t cover it, you expect the doctor to be your advocate and figure out a way to get you into that experimental protocol.<br><br>For everything, there is a season. That includes your personality – or, rather, your personalities. You see, we are really each composites of these different personalities. I hope you don’t interact with your children in the same way that you interact with your coworkers. I hope you don’t treat your spouse in the way that you treat subordinates at work. I hope your personality does vary depending upon the circumstance. And for that reason, I wish we could dispense with the label ‘personality’ altogether because it’s really a coping style. Problems arise when the coping style or personality displayed is inappropriate for the environment. And when does that happen? When your beliefs give rise to mental images that fail to accurately depict reality. As Alfred Korzybski, the noted semanticist states, “The map is not the territory.” If you want to do the things you know you can, but you just don’t, realize that you need a healthy mix of several personalities.
