                    <h1>Take Control<em> Over Your Life</em></h1>
                </div>
                <p>By posing questions and examining your beliefs, you have begun to take control. No, not control over other people, but control over yourself. Many people believe they have no choice but to relinquish control to others, especially under duress. They become embroiled in an altercation with their supervisor and then adopt the attitude that, “There’s nothing I can do. If I say anything or do anything, it won’t make any difference, and I’ll probably lose my job.” They believe they are helpless. This can wreak havoc upon the body. A very important belief to have is that you can do something. I’ll briefly review three studies to illustrate just what I mean.<br><br>
First, experiments have revealed that when rats are stressed, if they are able to press a bar and turn the stressor off, this control will offset some of the health problems that would arise if they lacked this control. In short, it is not the stressor that causes the health problems, but the belief that they have no control over it.<br><br>
Second, if rats have had control, and then the bar is disconnected, they still do better than rats that never had any control. This is because they believe things are still better. They still get shocked after pressing the bar, but based upon the previous experience, they perceive things are not as bad.<br><br>
Third, a large group of rats was given 10 shocks an hour. The day before, half of the rats received 20 shocks, and half received just one. Who suffered the most, even though the stressor is now identical for both groups? It was the group that previously received just one shock. Why? Because going from20 shocks to 10 instills a sense of optimism that things are getting better, while those animals that went from 1 shock to 10 have nothing to be optimistic about; for them, things are getting worse.<br><br>
These, and many other, well-controlled studies, clearly reveal that the belief that we are in control, even in the absence of any benefit, coupled with the belief that things are improving, are sufficient to not only lessen the stress response, but, significantly, to reduce the probability of developing stress-related illnesses. However, be careful with this concept of control. Too much control can be just as detrimental to your health as too little. This was revealed through studies in Vietnam. Investigators found that it was middle management, or the middle-level officers, who had to make a lot of very important decisions affecting the lives of many men under their command, who suffered most from the effects of stress, as compared to those troops who simply followed orders and went out into the rice paddies. So, having too much control – or too much responsibility –also can be detrimental to your health.<br><br>
But, being completely helpless is also a serious problem. That is why I strongly recommend that you always do something in a stress situation, even if the probability of a positive outcome is very remote. What is important is that you not act like a victim. So often when a person is in the midst of an altercation, especially in the workplace, they will shrug their shoulders, walk away from the problem, and adopt the attitude that, “There is nothing I can do. If I say anything or do anything, I will probably be put on the night shift for the rest of my life.” Or, “I’ll never get another day off. I might even lose my job.” So they walk down to the coffee pot, and they talk about the person behind his back, which, by the way, I strongly recommend you do. It’s when you internalize an emotion that it wreaks havoc on your immune system and on your overall health. If that’s all you do, it is going to be extremely detrimental to your health.<br><br>
When you walk away with the attitude that there is nothing you can do, you are acting like a victim, thereby, making your belief a self-fulfilling prophecy. If all you do is talk about the person, you will fuel your emotion without addressing the problem that gave rise to it. Ultimately, it will be detrimental not only to the person you are talking about, but to yourself as well.<br><br>
While it’s okay to talk about the situation, it’s preferable to do it with the person who has triggered your response. It may turn out that doing nothing is the best thing to do. But if you do nothing, make sure it is because you choose this as one of several options. Don’t do nothing because you believe that your hands are tied and that there are no other choices. Sometimes, doing nothing is, indeed, the best choice to make. But make sure that you give yourself a metaphorical bar to press.<br><br>
However, it is not always this simple. The fact is one size does not fit all. There are some people who believe that they must have complete control and responsibility over as many things in their environment as possible. And then there are other people who believe that it is best for someone else to do it all. There is nothing wrong with either belief. Problems arise when people who want responsibility and control are in situations where this desired responsibility and control are not available. Or, when people who feel more comfortable having someone else make the decisions are suddenly put in the driver’s seat. Once again, the problem is a mismatch between people’s beliefs and their environment.<br><br>
Additional conflict may arise because people change. You are not the same person under stress that you are when all is calm. Under pressure, you may become just the opposite of what you usually are. Most of the time, people will adhere to the belief that they developed in their family unit, so if they were encouraged to be inquisitive, or to argue, that’s probably the way they’ll be the rest of their lives. If they were encouraged to be silent and not to speak up, that will be their tendency. Then people will seek out employment and environments where there is a match between the ways they are comfortable responding and what they have to do. Under stress, however, the rules change. The same people who want control in times of calm may become acquiescing or accommodating under stress. On the other hand, people who have been accommodators will now suddenly seize the reins of control. But because this type of response is not one they are accustomed to experiencing, this lack of familiarity may give rise to yet another source of conflict. Realize that the critical variable of control is not a simple one.<br><br>
Actually, I’m not even sure if control itself should be the objective. Instead, it needs to be viewed as a process for achieving closure. Of course, you are more likely to experience closure when you are in control. At the same time, I think it is all right for someone else to have that control as long as the person giving it up is comfortable with the arrangement. There are some people who, obviously, cannot completely control their medical circumstances, but they trust in their doctor or other healthcare provider. The belief that the doctor is in control and will make the right decision can be just as good in accomplishing closure. So can a belief in a higher power -- believing that what is happening to me right now is part of some large, unified plan -- and that there is, ultimately, going to be a beneficial outcome. You don’t have to know what that outcome will be, or what direction things are going to go. But whether they get worse or whether they get better, the belief that this is part of some large plan and that there will, eventually, be closure can help some people deal with turmoil.<br><br></p>
